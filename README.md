# ONT Genomics
Oxford nanopore project for working with WGS of fungi

## Aim of project
Investigating the feasibility and quality of genome assemblies and taxonomic classification using Nanopore sequencing.

##Links to useful tools:

## Genome assembly, QC and QA

**ONT-Assembly-Polish** Assembly and polishing with Illumina reads
